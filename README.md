# SpendWise: The Gamified Financial Literacy App üí∏

Welcome to **SpendWise**! This is a fun, interactive web dashboard designed to help students and teenagers learn financial literacy by turning it into a game.

Instead of a boring spreadsheet, SpendWise lets you track your spending, set budgets, and earn XP and achievement badges for making smart money decisions. It also features an AI-powered coach (WiseBot) to answer all your financial questions!
This project was built from scratch using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, with a few powerful libraries to make it awesome.
